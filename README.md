# Traffic Light Exercise with React

## Exercise
The exercise consisted in **copying** a **traffic light** model that by **clicking** on it had to **illuminate** one light or the other, as shown in the original gif shown here:

## My work
I limited myself to use a **`useState`** that would store the selected colour and that by means of a ternary conditional inside the `Home` component in its `return` would add a new class if this `useState` contained one colour or another. Very simple but effective.

Here I show my particular result:

### To run my exercise:

To **run** it you only must **_install_** node.js by typing this in your workspace's terminal:
```
npm install
```

And then **_run_** it typing:
```
npm run start
```
